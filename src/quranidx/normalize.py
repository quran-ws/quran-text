"""Normalisation layers.

Four forms are derived from every raw token, each answering a different
question:

``uthmani``  the word as printed, minus pause marks and structural symbols.
             This is the canonical display form.
``folded``   ``uthmani`` with release-specific notation unified, so that the
             2022 and 2026 spellings of one reading compare equal.
``rasm``     the consonantal skeleton: the alignment key and the boundary
             between "same word, different vowelling" and "different word".
``simple``   plain modern spelling, for search and for human-readable diffs.
